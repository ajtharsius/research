This repository contains posters, presentations, papers, and code related to research I worked on between 2016 and 2022. Specifically, I worked on the following four projects.

* Evaluating Spending For Feeding America Partners (Oct. 2022 – Dec. 2022)
  * Advisor: Dr. Telesilla Kotsi
  *	Built a model to estimate the relationship between non-profit food bank spending relative to the total budget and marginal returns on fundraising.

* Computation of Graph Minors (Jan. 2019 – Apr. 2019)
  * Advisor: Dr. Bogdan Oporowski
  *	Analyzed the complexity of computing graph minors and solving related graph theory problems
  *	Presented on topics at internal conference and wrote a related paper

* Computation of Chain Complexes (Jan. 2017 – Apr. 2018)
  * Advisor: Dr. Lawrence Roberts
  *	Project completed through the Randall Research Scholars Program
  *	Analyzed the complexity of computing the Khovanov homology and its related chain complex through graph invariants
  *	Presented results at CBH Live 2017 and URCA 2018

* Bimodal Centrality Algorithms (Aug. 2016 – Apr. 2017)
  * Advisor: Dr. Elliot Blair
  * Project completed through the Randall Research Scholars Program
  *	Computed centrality values for a bimodal social network built from people and glass beads found in burial grounds at the Spanish mission Santa Catalina de Guale. These values were used to determine the important members of the community that lived at the mission
  *	Presented results at CBH Live 2016 and URCA 2017
